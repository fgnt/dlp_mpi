    Similar to the builtin function map, but the function is executed on the
    workers and the result is sent to the master process.

    A master process pushes tasks to the workers and receives the result.
    Pushing a task means to send an index to the worker and the worker
    processing the corresponding entry in the sequence.

    By default it is assumed that the sequence is indexable
    (i.e. sequence[3] is allowed). When this is not the case, the argument
    indexable can be set to False and the worker iterates through the
    sequence to get the correct item. In this case it is recommended that
    iterating through the sequence is fast.

    Requires at least 2 mpi processes, but to gain a speedup 3 are needed.
    Only rank 0 gets the results.
    This map is lazy. When the master process blocks in the for loop, the
    master process cannot submit new tasks to the workers.

    Assume function body is fast.

    Parallel: The execution of func.
