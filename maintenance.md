# PyPi upload

Package a Python Package/ version bump See: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

1. Update `setup.py` to new version number
2. Commit this change
3. Tag and upload

## Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install --upgrade wheel
pip install --upgrade twine
# pip install --upgrade bleach html5lib  # some versions do not work
pip install --upgrade bump2version
```

`bump2version` takes care to increase the version number, create the commit and tag.

```bash
bump2version --verbose --tag patch  # major, minor or patch
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
git push origin --tags
git push
twine upload dist/*

```
